# Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains my solution to the Titanic survival prediction Kaggle competition.

## Overview

The goal of this project was to predict who would survive the Titanic disaster. The project involved exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, feature engineering, machine learning explainability using SHAP values and permutation importance, and predictive modeling.

## Implementation

The implementation of the project can be found in the Jupyter notebook: [titanic-survival-prediction.ipynb](titanic-survival-prediction.ipynb).

## Results

I used several machine learning algorithms, including XGBoost, Logistic Regression, SVC, and KNN, and tuned their parameters using grid search. In the end, I used a voting classifier, which scored 79% on the test set, placing me in the top 8% of the competition.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-Learn
- XGBoost
