# Titanic_Survival_prediction
predicting who will survive the titanic ( a kaggle competition)

At this competition i tried to classify if a person will survive the titanic or not.

In the notebook you will find EDA, Data cleaning, feature engineering, machine learning explainability using shap values and permutation importance and predictive modeling

I used several machine learning algorithems: XGboost, LogisticRegression , SVC and KNN, and tuned their parameters using grid search

At the end i used a voting classifier which score 79% on the test set which was on the top 8%
